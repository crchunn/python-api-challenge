Checking weather to makes decision on vacation!

Looking for a new vacation spot? This challenge allows us to find several cities, some more populated than others to determine the best spot to go on vacation. The dataframe sets up to specify parameters about humidity, cloudiness and temperature! It also shows plotting to tell you how likely the temp will be warmer the closer you are to the equator. Hint - it's very likely!
There is also a vacation challenge, that helps you find the hotel that is suitably located in the city of your choice!
Have a great time!
